# Face recognition based attendance system 


### What is it? ü§î
Attendance System is a Web Application that lets the User gets his attendance marked by
utilising facial recognition. The User through this application can get his attendance marked
for numerous courses he has been added to. He can Register himself first and then log in to
his account. After that, he can contact the admin to get his profile updated. After that when
the admin sets up the user profile, the latter can mark his attendance by simply switching on
his camera, getting his photo clicked and submitting it. 
The application intends to serve as an efficient substitute for traditional attendance
systems. It can be used in Schools and University Institutions where attendance is considered
mandatory. 

### Vision of the Application üöÄ
This Application currently serves the basic need of a Student of keeping his attendance record but has the ability with extra features added to act as a Student Portal where the Student can not only mark or view his attendance but can also see his Number of classes attend out of number of classes held. And get his attendance percentage. Get Notified if attendance gets below the required percentage. Can view his grades also and have the chat feature to directly contact to his teacher through the Web Application. 



### Face Recognition API üíª
For comparing and recognizing faces, I have used [Face Recognition API](https://pypi.org/project/face-recognition/) .
It simply compares the face of the person with the face of the person in the database.
The images get compared using the Face Recognition Api which recognizes and manipulates faces
from python or from the command line. It‚Äôs built using dlib‚Äôs stat-of-the-art face
recognition. 
This compares a list of face encodings against a candidate encoding to see if they match. It
returns a list of True/False values indicating which known_face_encodings match the face
encoding to check. 
It requires C++ and Cmake to be installed in the system.


### Tech Stack üìë
1. Django

Django has been used to handle the authentication and Database. I have made use of one of its
most powerful features the Automatic admin Interface where an admin can manage content on the
site.

2. Bootstrap

Bootstrap has been used as a frontend framework to build this fast and responsive site with its various helpful JavaScript plugins alongside HTML & CSS. 

3. Python

Python was chosen as the backend language. 

### Functionalities 

The Functionalities that can be performed by the admin are:
1. Adding and Updating Courses.
2. Adding and Updating Student/User Profile.
3. Viewing successfully marked attendance and Users Attendance History.

The Functionalities that can be performed by the User are:
1. Register and Login
2. Mark his Attendance
3. View his Attendance
